## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
unzip("activity.zip")
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

1. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

```{r}
steps.date <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = activity, FUN=sum)
steps <- steps.date$steps
names(steps) <- steps.date$date
barplot(steps, xlab="date", ylab="steps")
```

2. Calculate and report the **mean** and **median** total number of
   steps taken per day

```{r}
mean(steps.date$steps)
median(steps.date$steps)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
