## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
unzip("activity.zip")
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
tsteps <- tapply(activity$steps, activity$date, sum)
barplot(tsteps, xlab="days", ylab="steps")
mean(tsteps, na.rm=TRUE)
median(tsteps, na.rm=TRUE)
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
